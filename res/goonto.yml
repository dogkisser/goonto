# Example Goonto configuration.
# Everything past the hash symbol (#) is a comment, and is ignored.

# If a configuration key Goonto expects isn't listed in this file, it uses a
# default instead, so you're welcome to create an empty goonto.yml file and
# only customise things you'd like to change.
# This file documents Goonto's defaults.

# Whether Goonto should run automatically when your computer starts.
run-on-boot: false

# Whether to write logs to a goonto.log file. Useful if something is going
# wrong, but you can generally leave this off.
save-logs: false

# The minimum amount of time Goonto must run before it will obey the quit
# keybind (in milliseconds).
minimum-run-time: 0

# The keybind used to exit Goonto. It's composed of a single key and an optional
# modifier.
# Available modifiers are: Alt, Shift, Ctrl, Super ("Windows Key").
# The latter key component can be any key on your keyboard. For a full list of
# technical key identifiers, see:
# https://w3c.github.io/uievents-code/#key-alphanumeric-writing-system.
# Note that on Linux, X is generally not happy with you binding things to Super.
exit-keybind: Ctrl + Backspace
# Other examples:
# exit-keybind: Alt + N
# exit-keybind: Super + 9

# This configures where Goonto will get its images from.
# You can either use the internet ("web") or local images ("local"). If the
# "local" key is a valid path, that is used, overriding web.
image-source:
  web:
    # Whether to download "sample" or "full" resolution images. Samples may be
    # significantly faster, particularly with high rates or slow connections,
    # but you may want to use "full" in case you see images you like and want
    # to save them.
    # Samples are more than high-res enough to look good in popups.
    image-res: sample

    # The booru to get images from. "e621.net", "realbooru.com", and
    # "rule34.xxx" are supported.
    booru: e621.net

    # This is a collection of tags added to every query. The default is
    # "score:>200 rating:explicit", which is generally fine in 99% of cases.
    # But if you'd like to see SFW or low-score posts, you may want to change it.
    tag-prefix: score:>200 rating:explicit

    # Tags to use to query boorus. Each line (beginning with a hyphen) is an
    # individual query, i.e., every tag on a given line will be used as part of
    # the search.
    tags:
      # - ~equine ~canine dominant_feral
      # - sugarlesspaints zebra -comic

  # Leave this empty to use web. Put a path here to use images from a folder on your
  # computer. Overrides web.

# Things Goonto will do.
# Most effects at least have the options "enabled" and "rate".
# Rate is how often the effect occurs, in milliseconds.
effects:
  # Popups that appear in random places on your screen.
  popups:
    enabled: false

    # Whether clicking a popup will close it.
    closable: true
    # How many milliseconds until the popup closes itself.
    # 0 Turns this off.
    closes-after: 0
    # How big images will be. You can set this to:
    # "auto": uses an algorithm based on the resolution of your display.
    # "any":  allow popups to be any size between fairly small to as large as
    #         your entire display.
    # "fullscreen": always makes images as big as they can be.
    # Or, you can write a number to which the image's size will be clamped.
    size: auto
    # Maximum number of popups that can be open at once.
    # 0 == unlimited
    max: 0
    # Whether clicking on a popup clicks the popup or the window underneath it.
    # "true" effectively disables closeable.
    click-through: false

    # (using "above"), or always kept below them (using "below").
    x-position: above
    # Here you can specify which monitors you want popups to display on.
    # Your options are either "all", "primary", or "except-primary", which are
    # pretty self explanatory, _or_ an array of numbers specifying specific monitors.
    # The mapping of numbers to monitors is unspecified, except 0 being the main
    # one, so I'd advise against depending on it. But it's there if you're so
    # inclined.
    # If only one monitor is connected, this setting is ignored.
    monitors: all
    # To use just your third monitor:
    # monitors: [2]
